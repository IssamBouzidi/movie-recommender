# Collaborative Filtering Based Movie Recommendation
Collaborative filtering is semi-supervised machine learning algorithm which learns latent features to do the recommendation.
The recommendation  is users based and it takes the response from the users to learn the latent features.  The response here 
is ratings given by the users to the movies.

Here, the system recommends user movies based on their ratings on other movies.

## Plan and Course of Action
1. We would use the Movielens dataset for modelling the algorithm.  
2. Implementation of the algorithm would be done both froom scratch as well as using libraries like Surprise library and 
Python Apache Spark.
3. Different implementations would be evaluated for accuracy and training efficiency.
3. The implementation would be showcased in web using Django.
## Project Status
The work is under progress and is in the phase of development.
